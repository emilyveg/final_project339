            <h1> Who We Are...</h1>
                <body>Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan (DMUM) is a student organization dedicated to raising funds and awareness for pediatric therapies at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital. Contrary to popular belief, we are not a dance group! Throughout the year, our members volunteer at therapies, fundraise, foster relationships with our DMUM families, and prepare for VictorThon where we stand for 24 hours to show our support For the Little Victors! There are countless ways to get involved with DMUM.

            <h1> Our History...</h1>
            <p>In 1997, Dance Marathon made its way to the University of Michigan. Inder Singh, DMUM’s founder, had heard of the positive impacts that Dance Marathons across the country were making on both the kids and families they support, as well as the students that stand. Consequently, he brought Dance Marathon to Ann Arbor.
                <br>
                <br>
                With help from the Children’s Miracle Network, 24 students on the first Central Planning Team set out to organize U of M’s first Marathon during the 1997-1998 school year.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the spring of 1998, Michigan’s first Dance Marathon came to fruition. Hundreds of dancers stood, and the organization raised $35,000 for pediatric rehabilitation therapies at Beaumont Children’s in Royal Oak, MI.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout DMUM’s 25 year history, the organization has raised nearly $6.5 million for our cause. Today we have expanded to support the University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital. In the spring of 2020, DMUM organized the first ever Virtual VictorThon in light of COVID-19.
